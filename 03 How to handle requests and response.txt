How google server responds?
	we make a request by visiting www.google.com
		What request? get request
	google  server responds by sending html,css,js files
	
	Why we didnt receive info? our server didnt send anything to browser

How to send browser information from our server to browser? .get()

Server.js
//jshint esversion:6
			const express = require('express');	
	//bind express function to app constant 
			const app = express()

		//where is request made  //what to do form server end on request
		//location of get request  //calbackfunction(request , response)
			app.get("/", function(request, response){
			console.log(request);
})
	//Listen to app on port 3000		//What is port? channel
			app.listen(3000)		//Our first server is built

Q) how request finds server? By specifying locaiton of request
Q) How app.listen works?
	1) create server object
	2) config to receive TCP connection on a specific port & IP
	3) once connection formed : client sends http request -> server can receive http request

Another short form

			app.get("/", function(req, res){		//can use any variable name? yes
			respond.send("Hello");
			respond.send("<h1>Hello World</h1>");
			console.log(request);
})
